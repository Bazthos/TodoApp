Hello Wolrd !

This is my solution to the FrontendMentor.io Challenge "Todo App"

It was coded in React.js without use of Hook :

    -> I've just learned React.js and wanted to understand the overall functioning of this framework;
    
    -> Really nice for understanding State and how to use it;

This is also the first project I've done with a theme. I mainly used the properties that JSX offers me to implement it, which is NOT a good idea in terms of performance. 

    -> For beginners in React.js and JSX though, I advise to go through this step to appreciate some of the power of JSX

I haven't reviewed my code to improve it, some improvements and a simplification of the whole are to be implemented (which I will do as I learn).

Enjoy and happy coding !
